# Biodiversity_Aanalysis

## Project Outline
The aim of the project was to analyse the growth/descent trends of different species across various locations which was subdivided into land zones based on the climatic conditions for 2 time periods namely, 1970-1990 & 2000-2013. <br>

## Steps performed
The steps involved in analysing the data include:
1. Data cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Hypothesis testing
4. Regression analysis (Linear & Multiple linear)
5. Country wise analysis of species richness across all land zones
<br>

## Packages used
1. dplyr
2. tidyr
3. stringr
4. ggplot2
5. knitExtra
